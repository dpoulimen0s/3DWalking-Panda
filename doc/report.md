###This is the report for practical-1 project
<p>Well in this project I used all of the tools that the practical project provided so far. 
This will probably enhance my productivity along with my motivation.</p>

####PyCharm
<p>This is the best IDE for python so far. I used to have VScode as text editor and IDE for python but PyCharm just make it easier for the developer to focus in his working project.</p> 

####Markdown
<p>I didn’t know about markdown language at all however I know html so that was easy for me to understand it and implement it to this report.</p>

####Adding a Dependency
<p>I knew how to install the requirements from some project but this is the first time that I create one. Easy and useful and important as well for functionality of the program.</p>

####Command Line Controls
<p>I didn’t know how to create arguments however instructions was clear and I figured it out fast. I will use arguments for my scripts from now on.</p>

####Git
<p>I think the git was the most useful of them because I have learned how to organize my code somewhere and work to it directly and update it on the spot.</p>
